# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
# Containerized local-dev / CI environment for a DaloyJS Cloudflare Worker.
#
# Production deploys go through `wrangler deploy` to Cloudflare's edge —
# **this Dockerfile is not a production runtime**. Ship the Worker to
# Cloudflare; use this image for:
#   - Reproducible local dev (devcontainers, GitHub Codespaces).
#   - CI smoke tests that exercise the Worker against `wrangler dev`'s
#     local workerd runtime without installing Node/pnpm on the runner.
#   - Air-gapped review apps that need to host `wrangler dev` behind a
#     reverse proxy.
#
# Hardening shipped out of the box:
#   - Non-root runtime user (uid 1001).
#   - Read-only-root-filesystem friendly: writes are confined to the
#     working dir; mount `/tmp` as tmpfs (`--read-only --tmpfs /tmp`).
#   - `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM` so wrangler's child workerd process gets a
#     clean shutdown signal.
#   - Minimal runner surface: no `curl`, no `bash` extras beyond what
#     `node:*-alpine` already ships. BusyBox `wget` powers the
#     HEALTHCHECK.
#   - `tini` as PID 1 for proper signal forwarding and zombie reaping
#     (important because wrangler spawns workerd as a child process).
#   - `npm ci --ignore-scripts` matches the
#     supply-chain defaults in `.npmrc` (no lifecycle scripts run).
#   - Base image is consumed through the `NODE_IMAGE` ARG so builds
#     can pin to an immutable digest:
#       docker build --build-arg \
#         NODE_IMAGE=node:24-alpine@sha256:<digest> .

# Override at build time to pin a specific digest.
ARG NODE_IMAGE=node:24-alpine
